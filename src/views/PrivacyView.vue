    <h2>Nothing is tracked</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not track anything. It does store data on your device (in so calles LocalStorage),
        but there is no server of any kind that stores your data. This means there is no need for accounts,
        sero cookies used by the app, but also does not allow for easy sharing of data across devices.
    </p>
    <h2>External services</h2>
    <p>
        While there are no tracking cookies used by the app, we do use some external services that may use
        alternative tracking methods. We refer to their respective Privacy Statements for further details.
        The services that we use are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="link-offset-2 link-offset-3-hover link-underline link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-75-hover" href="https://pages.github.com/">
                    Github Pages
                </a> for the hosting of the app
            </li>
            <li>
                <a class="link-offset-2 link-offset-3-hover link-underline link-underline-opacity-0 link-underline-opacity-75-hover" href="https://fonts.google.com/icons">
